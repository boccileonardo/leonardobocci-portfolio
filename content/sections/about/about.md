Hi, I'm Leo!

I'm an Italian expat, currently in Warsaw. 

My interests in data science and data engineering have brought me to my current role at Procter and Gamble, working in the POS sales data pipeline. 

I've graduated with honours at Kozminski University, with a thesis on machine learning algorithms applied to the stock market.

I love motorsport, cycling and travelling.
