Hi, I'm Leo!

I'm an Italian expat, currently in Warsaw. 

My interests in data science and IT have brought me to my current position in data & analytics at Procter and Gamble. 

I've graduated in Finance at Kozminski University, with a thesis on machine learning algorithms applied to the stock market. I'm also an active member of the Kozminski AI student club. 

I love motorsport, cycling and travelling.
